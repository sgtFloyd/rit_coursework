PLC Project 3 :: 10-28-2010

Problems 1-3 are in their own files names accordingly.

Problem 4 is split between index.php and report.php.
index.php contains the code to display the front page, to parse the expense reports and to update the database with the approproate data. report.php contains the code to grab all appropriate data from the database and display it on the webpage.
